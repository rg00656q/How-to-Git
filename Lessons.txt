Global flow of the system
There are 3 parts in it
	The project repository
	The staging area / index
	The git repository

When we are done working on a file we add it to the staging area
Once all is clear we use a commit to add it to the git repository
If some of the changes should not be recorded, we can remove them
Then save the changes as a part of the next commit

Once a commit is made, the staging area is not empty

git add X
	Can be used on a file that has been deleted
